## Faster R-CNN Model Code

This project implements Faster R-CNN from scratch using PyTorch components, applied to bone fracture detection on the FracAtlas dataset.

The goal is to deeply understand each step of the pipeline:
	•	Custom dataset loader following COCO-style annotations
	•	Manual backbone construction using ResNet-50 (C5 feature map)
	•	Manual anchor generation for the Region Proposal Network (RPN)
	•	Manual ROI pooling using MultiScaleRoIAlign
	•	Custom training loop with per-step and per-epoch logging
	•	Custom evaluator computing:
	•	mAP@50
	•	mAP@50–95
	•	Mean Average Recall (MAR)
	•	Mean IoU
	•	Visualization utilities for displaying predictions with ground-truth overlays

This implementation mirrors the original Faster R-CNN architecture but avoids using the high-level torchvision.models.detection.FasterRCNN wrapper, allowing full visibility and control over internal components.

A second notebook (provided separately) includes the standard torchvision Faster R-CNN model for performance comparison.
